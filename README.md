This is a project completed in the Fall of 2023 for the Independent Study course CS:5990 at University of Iowa

Project Description:
This project will discuss the relationship between Natural Gas Price Versus Heating Degree Day(HDD) by creating an accurate model using computer science concepts. This experience is relevant to building models that are utilized to predict real world metrics, such as oil future prices. The student will data gathered online to build a model to predict the two metrics, and perform a metanalysis on how accurate the model is.
